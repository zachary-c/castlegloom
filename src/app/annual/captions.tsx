Worked for Mere again and the big thing was building the massive convention registration system but I thought this picture of us playing Starcraft was more fun. Salt retreat with the fellas + ISU, the cats representing new living arrangements, and my first degree black belt + teaching TKD.

Personal website to host these is coming and we've been doing polls over at https://castlegloom.com/poll (let me know if you'd like to be polled)

Here's to 2025🥂`

It was not calmer.

The first image requires some explanation: my good friend Hudson and I have been taking Calculus classes at ISU for the past four semesters. We took Differential Equations this semester and got to skip the final, making the third unit test our fifteenth and final Calculus exam. This picture is from immediately after finishing that exam. woohoo ISU.

The rest are more straightforward: Black Recommend in TKD, time spent with the girl, and the rotated logo of Mere whom I have worked for since May. This year went better than last, I think -- I took hard college classes, went to New Orleans, tried to cook, and made a lot of memories with a certain someone.

Also, if all goes well I'll be migrating these end of year posts to a personal website -- working for a web company has made me a lot better at making internet things and instagram still sucks.

Until next year 🎉`

I know you'd understand.

A ledge at ISU, a high red belt, a boy and a girl, and a cat in a house.

Couple of honorable mentions include The Truth About Blayds this spring, graduating high school, and working for the DOT. It's been quite a year, and I hope this next one will be, if nothing else, calmer. Ah, but who am I kidding?`

2021 was a year. Prom was a grand time (shoutouts to our waiter Paul); CFA had a lot more responsibilities and became more fulfilling; ISU classes are neat and the campus is lovely; and I would be a red belt by now if not for the stupid derecho 2 windstorm (reschedule is in 5 days gonna be great).

Thank you to everyone who has made my year special 🥂`

export const caption_20 = `man, instagram sucks. deleting it is the best thing i’ve- oh, hello there.

the escape small group, cfa promotion, my dearest contemplative friend, and a brown belt.

ps i give it 50/50 odds i delete my insta account entirely by the end of next year, so text me on sc if you really don’t want that for some reason; i will likely delete it off my phone by the end of the day tomorrow.`

export const caption_19 = `Last year i was informed nobody had any idea what in the heck this was. hopefully more clear this time. *repost because i done gone and hecked up the selection on a corner of the 9 and it was bad and everyone would have instantly noticed*`
